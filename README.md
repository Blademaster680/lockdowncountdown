# Lockdown Countdown
This is a basic countdown app that I created that allows you to add your country through Django's admin interface. You will be asked for the date the lockdown started and the date the lockdown will end and it will start your countdown on the homepage as well as a progression bar that will fill up till the timer hits 0.
